# ts-protobuf
Leverage existing parsing in [golang/protobuf](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) to generate static TypeScript classes from `proto` files similar to the CLI in [dcodeIO/protobuf.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js/) for Javascript.

This project will be merged with [toba/wsrpc](https://github.com/toba/wsrpc).
